# General Assembly SEIR Polyglot
##### Written by Alex Merced

So you are near done with your GA SEIR Program and are interested in trying out a 3rd or even 4th language. Below you'll find lessons in a few other languages along with a walk-through on the basics of building an API with the most popular web framework in that language.

When learning web frameworks in different languages or the same language always keep in mind the larger pattern:

- migrations create, remove and update tables in your SQL database
- a model acts as an object to create/update/remove records in a table
- a controller houses related "action" functions
- routes point a particular url/endpoint to a action/controller function

## Self-Guided Lesson Markdowns

- [Python](/python)
- [Ruby](/ruby)
- [PHP](/php)
- [Java](/java)
- [C#](/cs)
- [GO](/go)
- [Rust](/rust)

- [React, Angular, Svelte, Vue](/frontend)

**all the language lessons build the same todos api with postgres and the frontend lessons consume it, so mix and match**

## Other Languages

- Swift is the scripting language that has become popular for building iOS apps, popular web frameworks include Vapor and Kitura

- Elixir is a functional language that uses the Erlang Virtual Machine, the concurrency features of the EVM have made Elixir a growing language with its Phoenix framework.
